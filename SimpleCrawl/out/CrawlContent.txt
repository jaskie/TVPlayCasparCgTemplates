This inconvenient little bit of neuroscience has bothered me ever since I came across a famous Carl Jung quote: 
“What you resist not only persists but will grow in size.” 
If resisting a behavior I want to change is not only ineffective but harmful, then what should I do instead?
One trick is to pull a little bait and switch on your own brain. 
It goes like this: When the urge comes to do the counterproductive thing, don’t resist. Instead, replace.
